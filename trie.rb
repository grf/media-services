# Randy Fischer (rf@ufl.edu) reimplemented this wheel on 2010-06-13.  Pleasant exercise.

# Build a trie (a kind of sorted hash) - my initial goal was to find
# the largest common prefix from a list of strings.  This also does
# the usual trie tricks: stores key/value pairs, orders the keys,
# searchs for all substrings given a match pattern, etc.

class Trie

  # Box let's us put a value into a box, then get it out of the box.
  # We need this because we'd like to store nil and false values on
  # a node slot.  So a slot can have one of two values: nil (meaning
  # no value), or a box (with some value in it, including nil).

  class Box

    def initialize thing

    def unwrap
      value

    def to_s
      "#<box##{self.object_id}: #{value.inspect}>"
    end
  end

  # A node stores a single character, pointers to children nodes, and perhaps a boxed value.
  #
  # Example Node: < letter => 'a', value => 'adjective, also the indefinite article, refers...', children => [ <node>, <node> .. ] >
